## About

This is a script to dump Postini users and settings from a shell. Edit and pipe away for your own needs.

## Usage

Edit the variables in the script for your needs, and hack away at the output to bend it to your will. I call this script from cron monthly to output a list of domains and user counts per domain, but it basically dumps all users and their settings into a giant csv that you can then parse with any stream processing tool you want.
